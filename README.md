# CS 434: Machine Learning & Data Mining

An upper-division course at Oregon State University in supervised and unsupervised learning.

There are 4 implementation assignments in the course.  Here's a brief overview of each of them!  More detailsto be added when I get around to polishing this repo up.

### Assignment 1: Linear Regression & Logistic Regression with Regularization

Comparing training and testing accuracy over iterations of batch gradient descent.  Performing linear regression on the Boston Housing dataset of housing prices in the Boston suburbs.  Logistic regression (as a classifier) on USPS handwritten digits 4 and 9.

Here's an example of the logistic regression at work:
